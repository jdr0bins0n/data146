## WealthC

**Perform a linear regression and compute the MSE. Standardize the features and again computer the MSE. Compare the coefficients from each of the two models and describe how they have changed**

The  ùëÖ^2  value of the non-standardized data is 0.7335385259217961and the MSE is 0.4466387646252814. Both coefficients are good indicators that the features can somewhat accurately predict the target variable, wealthC. The  ùëÖ2  value is fairly close to +1, meaning there is a postive correlation between the features and target and the MSE is fairly close to 0, which means that the difference between the model's prediction and the actual target values is fairly small. However, if possible we'd like to minimize this difference even more.

Standardizing the data did not change the results. The purpose of standardizing data is to minimize the difference between the scales of features while maintaining the difference in teh range of values. However, because most of our data is binary, the features are already on the same scale. Therefore, standardization is unhelpful in this case.

**Run a ridge regression and report your best results.**

Optimum alpha value was 1.616 and gave a test data score of 0.7328 and a train data score of 0.734. When I computed the MSE, the minimum test MSE was 0.446 and minium train MSE was 0.433. While these values did not change much from the linear regression, they do indicate that the model is well fit, since the testing and training scores are very close

**Run a lasso regression and report your best results.**

The optimal alpha value was 0 and gave the test data score of 0.733 and train data score of 0.734. Like the Ridge regression, the Lasso regression did not improve the training or testing score. However, the MSE changed drastically. For Lasso regression the MSE rose to 1.67 for both the training and testing data. Becuase the MSE was so much worse, I believe Lasso is not the best model.

## WealthI

**Perform a linear regression and compute the MSE. Standardize the features and again computer the MSE. Compare the coefficients from each of the two models and describe how they have changed**
Similar to the wealthC, standardizing the data did not do much to increase the  ùëÖ2  value. For wealthI, the coefficient of determination was 0.824, which is marginally better than the results of wealthC. However, the MSE was gregariously large, which is concerning. The MSE for both the standardized and non-standardized data was 1,773,535,271, which should mean that the model is able to accurately predict the target variable.

**Run a ridge regression and report your best results.**

The optimal alpha value for the Ridge model was 1.010 and yielded a testing and training data score of 0.823 and 0.824 respectively. This did not improve from the linear regression model. Furthermore, the MSE of both the testing and training data still hovered around 1,770,000,000 for both the testing and training data.

**Run a lasso regression and report your best results.**

The optimal value for the Lasso regression was `0.00` and had the same $R^2$ and MSE values as the linear and ridge model.

The model that produced the best results in predicting wealth of all persons throughout the smaller West African country was the linear regression model of the target wealthI. This model was the best becuase it had the highest  ùëÖ2  value as well as the lowest MSE. Both these values indicate that the data is fairly correlated and the feautures can be used to predict the target value fairly well.
