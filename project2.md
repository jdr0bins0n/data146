**Describe continuous, ordinal and nominal data. Provide examples of each.**

Continuous data is numerical data that exists as a range of values. Common examples of continuous data are temperature, height, and grade percentage. 

Ordinal data is categorical data that has an inherent order. An example of ordinal data are rankings, like the order a group finishes a race, or the title of a person in a chain of command. 

Nominal data is categorical data that does not have in inherent order, like dates, color, or gender.

If I wanted to predict someone's income based off their gender and socioeconomic status, this would be an example of a model that includes all three types of data. The person's income would be numerical data, gender nominal data, and education ordinal data. 
My features are the variables I want to use as predictors, so they would be education and gender. My target would be what I am trying to predict, which would be a person's income.
